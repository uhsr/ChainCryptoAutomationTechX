# ChainCryptoAutomationTechX

## Description

A framework for building zero-knowledge proof circuits using a custom DSL optimized for elliptic curve arithmetic, enabling verifiable computation with minimal on-chain footprint via Groth16 proofs.

## Features

- Implements a decentralized key management system using Shamir's Secret Sharing.
- Utilizes zero-knowledge proofs to enable private data sharing between blockchains.
- Integrates a hardware security module (HSM) for secure storage of private keys.
- Develops a custom consensus mechanism based on Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) optimized for high throughput.
- Automates cross-chain asset transfers using Hash Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs).
- Provides a RESTful API for programmatic interaction with the blockchain network.
- Deploys a permissioned blockchain network using Hyperledger Fabric for enterprise applications.
- Enables automated smart contract deployment and execution through a CI/CD pipeline.
